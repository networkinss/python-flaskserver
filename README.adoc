= OpenAPI generated server

== Overview

This server was generated by the https://openapi-generator.tech[OpenAPI Generator] project. By using the
https://openapis.org[OpenAPI-Spec] from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub. This
is an example of building a OpenAPI-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the https://github.com/zalando/connexion[Connexion] library on top of Flask.
